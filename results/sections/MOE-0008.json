      "compliance": "partially_compliant",
      "reasoning": "The MOE defines critical maintenance tasks, gives examples (controls, engine/propeller installation, tasks identified via error analyses, occurrence reporting, bulletins, accident reports, audits, operating experience, training feedback), and requires an additional independent inspection with RII/Insp markings. It also defines re‑inspection when only one person is available and states that this is an exceptional case and that the same person may perform the re‑inspection as a separate work step. However, it does not clearly state that re‑inspection is only allowed in unforeseen circumstances, nor does it explicitly state that circumstances are not ‘unforeseen’ if the organisation failed to assign an independent qualified person. It also does not clearly require recording the details of the re‑inspection (beyond a generic stamp/marking) on the work card, nor does it explicitly state that the CRS is issued only after re‑inspection is satisfactorily completed.",

      "recommended_fix": "Amend the critical task / re‑inspection subsection as follows (example wording, to be adapted to MOE style):\n\n\"Re‑inspection of critical maintenance tasks\n\nRe‑inspection is subject to the same conditions as the independent inspection, except that the authorised person performing the maintenance task also acts as the independent qualified person and performs the inspection.\n\nRe‑inspection for critical maintenance tasks is permitted only in unforeseen circumstances when only one person is available to carry out the task and perform the independent inspection. Circumstances are not considered unforeseen if the organisation has not assigned a suitable independent qualified person to that particular task in the planning phase.\n\nThe certificate of release to service (CRS) for a critical maintenance task may only be issued by the authorised person after the re‑inspection has been satisfactorily completed.\n\nThe work card/maintenance list shall record, in addition to the RII/Insp marking, at least: the identification of the authorised person, the date of the re‑inspection, and a brief description or reference to the details of the re‑inspection performed.\"\n\nAlso clarify the definition of critical tasks by explicitly listing the data sources, e.g.: \"Critical maintenance tasks are identified using, inter alia, information from the type certificate/STC holder, accident and incident reports, occurrence reporting, audit results, normal operations monitoring, and training feedback.\""

It also states that the checks may be carried out or supervised by a person qualified for the task.
