The organisation is responsible for assessing the competency of the holder ... The organisation should specifically ensure that the individual competencies have been established with regard to: relevant knowledge, skills and experience ... and knowledge of the associated organisation and operator procedures.",
      "compliance": "partially_compliant",
      "reasoning": "The MOE requires HTA personnel to have at least 5 years’ maintenance experience and a valid ICAO maintenance licence with type rating, and it states that the organisation obtains and maintains evidence of experience and licence. It also describes induction, refresher and recurrent training (including Part‑145/MOE procedures, human factors, technical data, etc.) and that training achievements are recorded. However, it does not clearly describe a structured competency assessment process (initial and recurrent) to verify that licence holders are competent for the specific scope of authorisation, nor does it explicitly address assessment of differences between generic type training and the specific aircraft configuration.",
      "risk": "medium",
      "recommended_fix": "Add a dedicated subsection describing the competency assessment process for certifying and support staff, for example:\n\n\"Before issuing or extending any HTA (certifying staff) or support staff authorisation, the Technical Manager (or nominated assessor) shall perform and document a competency assessment covering:\n- relevant knowledge, skills and experience for the specific aircraft type/model/variant and configuration to be maintained;\n- understanding and correct application of organisation and operator procedures (e.g. component handling and identification, MEL use, technical log use, independent checks, maintenance records);\n- attitude towards safety and observance of procedures.\n\nThe assessment may include oral questioning, practical observation at the workplace and/or written tests. Results are recorded in the personnel training/authorisation file and are reviewed at least every 2 years or when the scope of authorisation changes. Holding a Part‑66 licence and type rating alone is not sufficient for authorisation; the documented competency assessment must be satisfactory.\""
