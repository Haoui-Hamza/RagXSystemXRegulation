      "reasoning": "The MOE text provides a narrative description of the organisation’s scope of work (aircraft and equipment maintenance, A1/A2, C14 landing gear, line/workshop/equipment maintenance, reference to a separate Component Capability List). However, the description is fragmented, not clearly structured as a formal ‘terms of approval’ specification, and some key elements (exact aircraft types, ratings, locations, limitations) are only vaguely referenced or delegated to other sections without clear cross‑reference. This only partially fulfils the requirement for a clear specification of scope of work relevant to the approval.",
      "risk": "medium",
      "recommended_fix": "Introduce a clearly structured subsection titled e.g. “2.x Scope of Work / Terms of Approval (145.A.70(a)(9))” that: (1) explicitly lists the organisation’s ratings and limitations in the same structure as the approval certificate (e.g. A1 Aeroplanes above 5700 kg – [list types]; A2 Aeroplanes 5700 kg and below – [list types]; C14 Landing Gear – [list types/part numbers]); (2) clearly references the Component Capability List as a controlled MOE attachment, including its document identifier and revision control; (3) clearly states any line maintenance limitations (e.g. ‘Line maintenance is limited to the tasks listed in Appendix X and within AMC 145.A.10 point 1, at locations listed in section 1.8.4’). Replace the current long paragraph starting with “Organization work scope The maintenance organization can perform maintenance…” with a concise, tabulated scope of work aligned with the approval certificate."

This makes several procedures difficult to understand and does not meet the expectation of consistent terminology or simplified English for an English‑language MOE.",

For example: \n- Replace “capabilities temporary lack of identified and are taken into account work orders in approval” with “Any temporary lack of capability is identified and considered before accepting or approving a work order.”\n- Replace “Provided something like that paragraph influence maintenance readiness, so technical manager does they measures, which the required readiness is achieved” with “If any of the above changes affect maintenance capability, the Technical Director shall take the necessary actions to restore the required capability before further work is accepted.”\nEnsure consistent use of defined terms such as ‘maintenance capability’, ‘scope of work’, ‘Technical Director’, ‘NAA’, ‘work order’, and cross‑references to other MOE sections.

      "reasoning": "The MOE text mentions that maintenance readiness of machines that are occasionally serviced is activated at the latest when the work order is approved, and that temporary lack of capability is taken into account in work order approval. This shows some linkage between capability and work order acceptance. However, it does not describe how the organisation ensures that a clear contract or work order exists with defined scope, responsibilities, and applicable maintenance data before starting work, nor does it reference the elements of a maintenance contract as suggested by the GM.",

The contract/work order shall clearly define: (a) aircraft/ component identification; (b) requested work and applicable maintenance data; (c) responsibilities for continuing airworthiness and records; (d) any limitations or special conditions. The organisation shall verify that it has the necessary capability (personnel, tools, data, facilities) before accepting the work order.

It also states that changes are discussed with the NAA before implementation where possible, and that EASA Form 2 and Form 4 are used. However, it does not clearly distinguish which changes require prior approval under 145.A.85(a) versus those that are managed under the ‘changes not requiring prior approval’ procedure in 145.A.85(c). The text also suggests that even indirectly approved MOE changes are only implemented after NAA confirmation of receipt, which is not clearly aligned with the concept of an internally approved procedure for non‑prior‑approval changes. The procedure is therefore only partially aligned with 145.A.85.",
      "risk": "medium",
      "recommended_fix": "Revise the ‘CHANGES NOTIFICATION’ and ‘ORGANIZATION MANUAL AMENDMENT PROCEDURE’ subsections to: (1) explicitly list the changes that require prior approval in accordance with 145.A.85(a) (certificate/terms of approval, nominated persons, reporting lines, procedure for non‑prior‑approval changes, additional locations) and state that these changes will not be implemented until formal approval is received from the NAA; (2) define a separate, NAA‑approved procedure for changes not requiring prior approval under 145.A.85(c), including how they are internally approved (e.g. by Technical Director) and how/when they are notified to the NAA; (3) clarify that MOE changes within the scope of the indirect approval procedure may be implemented in accordance with the NAA‑approved indirect approval agreement, without waiting for explicit NAA confirmation of receipt, if that is consistent with the authority’s policy. Use clear headings such as ‘2.x Changes Requiring Prior Approval (145.A.85(a))’ and ‘2.y Changes Not Requiring Prior Approval (145.A.85(c))’ and cross‑reference the MOE amendment procedure."

      "reasoning": "The MOE describes an amendment procedure: page headers with revision level and date, no handwritten or temporary changes, change marking with vertical lines, use of a change list, electronic submission to NAA, distribution list, and archiving of old versions. It also describes an ‘indirect approval’ method for certain minor changes. This shows a structured control of the MOE. However, the description is somewhat confusing, mixing direct and indirect approval, and does not clearly state that the MOE must always reflect the organisation’s current structure and procedures. Some responsibilities (e.g. for ensuring all holders update their copies) are described but not very clearly. Overall, the control system is present but not clearly and simply described.",
      "risk": "low",
      "recommended_fix": "Clarify and streamline the MOE amendment procedure. For example: (1) Start with a clear policy statement: “The MOE shall at all times reflect the current organisation, facilities, personnel and procedures.” (2) Separate the process into ‘a) Changes requiring NAA approval’ and ‘b) Changes eligible for indirect approval’, describing for each who drafts, who approves internally, what is sent to NAA, and when the change may be implemented. (3) Clearly describe the distribution process: how personnel are informed, how electronic copies are updated, and how obsolete copies are withdrawn. (4) Use simple, unambiguous language and remove redundant or contradictory sentences (e.g. about when changes can be implemented)."

However, it does not specify which documents are acceptable (EASA Form 1 or equivalent) nor does it reference the types of equivalent documents listed in AMC1 145.A.42(a)(i).

It also states that the maintenance organisation does not use subcontractors. This provides a basic supplier control concept but does not describe a formal supplier evaluation/approval process, criteria, periodic review, or how safety risk management and compliance monitoring interact with supplier control. For subcontractors, stating ‘no subcontractors’ is acceptable if true, but the MOE should still define what would be considered a subcontractor and how such arrangements would be controlled if introduced.",
