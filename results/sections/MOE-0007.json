However, it does not: (1) define critical maintenance tasks in line with the examples in the AMC (flight controls, stability systems, propulsion, etc.); (2) describe a systematic process and data sources for identifying critical tasks; (3) clearly define the independent inspection/reinspection concept, roles (‘authorised person’ vs ‘independent qualified person’), documentation of the reinspection on work cards, or the conditions under which reinspection is allowed when only one person is available; and (4) does not explicitly require an error‑capturing method after any critical maintenance task as such, only for the specific ‘recurring error’ scenario it defines.",
      "risk": "high",
      "recommended_fix": "Expand and clarify the ‘CRITICAL MAINTENANCE TASKS CONTROL’ subsection as follows:\n\n1) Definition and identification of critical maintenance tasks\n- Add text such as:\n  \"Critical maintenance tasks are those whose incorrect performance could have a significant effect on flight safety. As a minimum, the following tasks are considered for classification as critical:\n   • tasks that may affect the control of the aircraft, flight path and attitude, such as installation, rigging and adjustment of flight controls;\n   • tasks that may affect aircraft stability control systems (e.g. autopilot, fuel transfer systems);\n   • tasks that may affect the propulsive force of the aircraft, including installation of engines, propellers and rotors;\n   • overhaul, calibration or rigging of engines, propellers, transmissions and gearboxes; and\n   • any other tasks identified from accident/incident reports, occurrence reporting, audits, flight data analysis, feedback from training or information from the design approval holder.\n  The Technical Director is responsible for ensuring that critical tasks are identified, listed and kept up to date in the maintenance planning and work card system.\"\n\n2) Error‑capturing method and independent inspection\n- Add a dedicated subsection, for example:\n  \"For each critical maintenance task, an error‑capturing method shall be applied after completion of the task. The primary method used by the organisation is independent inspection:\n   • The ‘authorised person’ is the person who performs or supervises the task and is responsible for its completion in accordance with the maintenance data.\n   • The ‘independent qualified person’ is a person, other than the authorised person, who performs an independent inspection of the completed task and confirms that it has been correctly carried out and that no deficiencies have been found. The independent qualified person does not issue the certificate of release to service and is not required to hold certification privileges.\n   The independent inspection shall be recorded on the work card or electronic task record, including the identification of the authorised person, the independent qualified person, the date and a reference to the inspected task.\"\n\n3) Reinspection when only one person is available\n- Add text aligned with the AMC concept of reinspection, for example:\n  \"If, in unforeseen circumstances, only one person is available to perform a critical maintenance task, reinspection may be used as an error‑capturing method. In this case, the authorised person performs the task and then performs a reinspection of the task after a suitable break. The circumstances are considered unforeseen only when the grounding of the aircraft or the need for the task could not reasonably have been predicted and no suitable independent qualified person can be made available. The work card shall record that reinspection has been used, including the date, details of the reinspection and the identification of the authorised person. The certificate of release to service is issued only after satisfactory reinspection.\"\n\n4) Multiple‑error prevention in identical tasks\n- Clarify the existing text to state explicitly:\n  \"To minimise the possibility of an error being repeated in identical tasks involving removal/installation or assembly/disassembly of several components of the same type fitted to more than one system, maintenance planning shall, whenever practicable, assign different persons to perform identical tasks on different systems. Where this is not possible, the error‑capturing method described above (independent inspection or reinspection) shall be applied.\""

Overload cases are discussed in quality meetings. However, it does not: (1) explicitly state that the man‑hour plan is reviewed at least every 3 months; (2) define ‘significant deviation’ as >25 % shortfall in available man‑hours in a calendar month and require reporting to the compliance monitoring manager and accountable manager; (3) explicitly include all maintenance workload elements listed in the AMC (planning, records checks, worksheets, inspections, etc.); and (4) describe a formal risk assessment and mitigation procedure when actual staff is below planned levels, including the link to the management system/compliance monitoring function.",

The plan is formally reviewed at least every 3 months and updated when necessary.\"\n\n2) Significant deviation and reporting\n- Add a definition and reporting line:\n  \"A significant deviation from the maintenance man‑hour plan is defined as more than a 25 % shortfall in available man‑hours during a calendar month for any of the functions covered by 145.A.30(d). Any significant deviation shall be reported by the Technical Director through the relevant departmental manager to the Compliance Monitoring Manager and the Accountable Manager for review. Such deviations may also be reported through the internal safety reporting scheme.\"\n\n3) Risk assessment when staffing is below plan\n- Add a risk‑based procedure:\n  \"If the actual number of staff available on any shift or period is less than the planned staffing level, the Technical Director (or delegate) shall perform and document a risk assessment. This assessment will consider the type and volume of work, criticality of tasks, available competence, and potential impact on safety and compliance. Based on the assessment, appropriate mitigation measures (e.g. rescheduling work, limiting scope of maintenance, using additional contracted staff, increased supervision or independent inspections) shall be implemented. The assessment and mitigations shall be recorded and made available to the Compliance Monitoring Manager.\"\n\n4) Link to compliance monitoring\n- Add:\n  \"The Compliance Monitoring Manager monitors the effectiveness of the man‑hour planning process and the handling of significant deviations as part of the management system in accordance with 145.A.200.\""
