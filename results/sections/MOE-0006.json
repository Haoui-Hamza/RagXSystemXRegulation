      "compliance": "partially_compliant",
      "reasoning": "The MOE states that before issuing a CRS the issuer must ensure all maintenance has been carried out and recorded, that the aircraft is airworthy to the extent required by the work order, and that a CRS is not issued if it is suspected the aircraft is not airworthy. It also describes handling of deferred defects and states that a CRS is not issued if the combined effect of deferred defects is suspected to endanger flight safety. However, the text does not clearly state that a CRS may be issued when maintenance is incomplete only within approved aircraft limitations and with explicit recording of those limitations, as required by 145.A.50(e) and M.A.801(f). The wording uses “suspected” rather than clearly prohibiting CRS in any known non‑compliance that endangers flight safety.",

In such cases, the CRS shall clearly state which maintenance could not be completed and shall indicate all applicable airworthiness and operational limitations in accordance with the approved data (e.g. MEL, maintenance programme, ADs, CAME procedures).\n\nA CRS shall not be issued in the case of any known non‑compliance which endangers flight safety, as defined in GM1 145.A.50(a).\""

When an organisation maintains a component for its own use, the EASA Form 1 may not be necessary if the organisation’s internal release procedures in its MOE so provides. ...

This internal release shall be documented in the work order/maintenance records and shall clearly identify the component, the work performed, the applicable maintenance data, and the certifying staff.\n- A component maintained off the aircraft requires: (a) a CRS (EASA Form 1 or internal release) for the off‑aircraft maintenance, and (b) a separate aircraft CRS when the component is installed on the aircraft.\n\nThe detailed internal release procedure for own‑use components is described in section [x.x.x] of this MOE.\""

      "reasoning": "The MOE describes a \"temporary maintenance certificate\" situation where an aircraft is left away from the usual maintenance location due to lack of a spare part with an appropriate maintenance certificate. It allows a temporary CRS when a useful spare part without appropriate documentation is installed, with operator’s written consent, and limits use to return to home base or 30 flight hours. This aligns with the 30‑hour limit and operator agreement. However, it does not clearly require that the component has a suitable release certificate (even if not the fully appropriate one) and that all applicable maintenance and operational requirements are otherwise met, as specified in 145.A.50(f).

This is broadly aligned with the concept of a CRS with limitations. However, the text does not explicitly require that the CRS itself clearly states that maintenance could not be completed and lists all applicable airworthiness/operational limitations, as required by M.A.801(e)(4). The prohibition on CRS in any known non‑compliance that endangers flight safety is only indirectly covered via HTA judgement and \"suspected\" wording.",
