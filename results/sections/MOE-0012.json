It also explains that training and experience are recorded on training cards with attached certificates. However, the procedures are fragmented, not clearly structured, and key elements are missing or vague: no clear description of the internal authorisation system (authorisation types, scope, format, validity periods, suspension/revocation), no explicit link between Part‑66 licences and company authorisations, no explicit retention periods for records, and terminology is inconsistent and sometimes unclear (e.g. “installer clearance qualifications”, “Mechanic A person…”).",

Use clear, simplified English and consistent terminology throughout."

It states that qualification requires tools and knowledge of instructions plus practical skill, which the technical manager may verify by a demonstration test. This addresses the existence of special qualifications and a basic qualification principle. However, it does not describe a full procedure: no details on training content/standards, qualification criteria, validity periods, recurrent training, re‑authorisation, record‑keeping, or how these activities are controlled as specialised processes within the maintenance system.",

This covers the requirement that external teams are supervised and that they issue a maintenance release. However, it lacks a defined procedure: no criteria for selection/approval of external teams, no description of how work is planned, controlled and integrated into the organisation’s system, how findings are managed, or how records are handled.",

This addresses the need for a process to deviate from approved maintenance data. However, the procedure is not fully clear: responsibilities between operator and maintenance organisation are not sharply defined, the internal steps (documentation, risk assessment, record‑keeping) are not detailed, and terminology is confusing in places.",

It states that the exception procedure is accepted by the NAA and implemented by the technical director, and that the exception report is attached to the organisation’s records.
