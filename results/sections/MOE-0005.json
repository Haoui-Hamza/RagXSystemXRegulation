      "compliance": "partially_compliant",
      "reasoning": "The MOE states that maintenance is performed on the basis of the operator’s work order and that the work order is placed on a form prepared by the operator or maintenance person and signed by both parties. However, it does not clearly define the minimum content of the work order or how the organisation ensures that all elements of the maintenance contract (scope, responsibilities, data provision, AD responsibility, etc.) are addressed before work starts, as suggested by the GM reference.",

The work order or associated contract shall, as applicable, define: (1) aircraft identification and total time/cycles; (2) detailed description and reference of the tasks to be performed (including ADs, SBs, SC/SR, defect rectification and deferred items); (3) responsibilities for provision and currency of maintenance data; (4) responsibilities for AD/SB status control; (5) any subcontracting or use of other Part‑145 organisations; and (6) specific customer requirements and limitations.

Terminology for key roles and documents (e.g. HTA, technical leader, maintenance certificate, work order, trip log, logbook/technical logbook) is not clearly defined and is used inconsistently.

Remove ambiguous phrases and correct grammar so that procedures are unambiguous. Example: \"Deferred defects are recorded and controlled in the aircraft technical log.
