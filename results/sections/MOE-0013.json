It is also internally inconsistent because it refers to a 'CATALOG SUBCONTRACTING' while stating that no subcontractors are used.

The subcontracted organisation works under the management system and approval of this organisation.\n(b) Scope of subcontracted work\nDescribe which types of work may be subcontracted (e.g. specialised processes, specific line tasks, component work) and ensure they are within the organisation’s own scope of approval.\n(c) Selection and pre-audit\nBefore adding a subcontractor, the Compliance Monitoring function performs and documents a pre-audit to verify that the subcontractor’s facilities, personnel, tools, equipment, maintenance data and procedures meet the intent of Part-145 and this MOE.\n(d) Contract and interfaces\nThe contract defines responsibilities, use of facilities, tools, maintenance data and paperwork, and establishes interfaces for occurrence and internal safety reporting.\n(e) Oversight and monitoring\nSubcontracted activities are included in the hazard identification, risk management and compliance monitoring programme. Periodic audits are performed and recorded.\n(f) List of subcontractors\nAn up-to-date list of approved subcontractors, including scope of work and locations, is maintained in Appendix XX of this MOE.\"\nThen create and maintain the referenced subcontractor list appendix."
